6.	What all does smartstudy.net offer?<br /><br />

7.	How will the System help me learn faster?<br /><br />

The Formative Assessment System is an adaptive assessment (test) engine designed to measure a student's understanding of the underlying concepts and uniquely identify every individual student's weak areas within a given topic. The questions that a student sees will be based on his/her response to the previous question, thereby no two students will see exactly the same set of questions.<br />

The three steps are:<br />
•	Step 1: Take an assessment (test)<br />
•	Step 2: View report that summarizes your performance.<br />
•	Step 3: Get a customized study plan on the basis of your performance.<br /><br />

Can I take test for a topic more than once?<br /><br />
The Formative Assessments available on smartstudy.net help in identifying concepts that you are weak in. The adaptive nature of the Formative Assessment system thus begins its process of searching for 'weak links' in your understanding of concepts from the minute you mark your response to the first question. The system therefore does not allow you to re-take the assessment for a given topic once you have completed it.<br /><br />

8.	Are the solutions updated as per the latest curriculum?<br /><br />

Yes, the  solutions available on smartstudy.net are aligned to the latest curriculum. The end-of-chapter  solutions are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that students access only updated and relevant content. <br /><br />

9.	I am unable to listen to the audio and/or view the videos on your site? What could be the possible reason?<br /><br />

If you are unable to listen to the audio or view the video on our site, please check the speed of your Internet connection and also ensure that your PC has a Flash player. You'll need a broadband connection with at least 256+ Kbps for best viewing experience. 
If the problem persists, please contact us on our details given on site.<br /><br />

10.	Is it sufficient if I only read the study material?<br /><br />

While 'Study material' is intended to clarify your understanding of concepts, it is equally important to assess your learning through Test Papers, Activities and Formative Assessments. <br /><br />

11.	How do the interactive games and activities help me learn?<br /><br />

The interactive games and activities help to speed up the learning process by providing the learner an opportunity to learn by 'doing'. This active involvement of the learner helps in revising concepts previously learned, while at the same time keeping the fun element in the learning process intact.<br /><br />

12.	How will Revision Notes help me prepare for my exams?<br /><br />

Revision Notes are concise, end-of-chapter highlights that will help you to quickly revise the main concepts just before an exam. These ready-to-use Revision Notes are complete with diagrams and simple illustrations to help in quickly understanding key concepts. You can even print these notes to keep them handy for last minute revisions.<br /><br />
 
13.	Is studying using the Revision Notes enough to guarantee a good performance in the exams?<br /><br />

Revision Notes are intended to help students quickly refresh their memory for all important concepts in the chapter. However, to make the revision exercise thoroughly effective students should also go through the Practice Tests available for every chapter and also take the full-course Model Test papers. A thorough revision exercise such as this alone can help students face their exams confidently.<br /><br />
